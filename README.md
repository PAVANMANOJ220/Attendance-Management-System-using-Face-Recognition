# Attendance Management System using Face Recognition

## Overview
The **Attendance Management System** is a Python-based application that leverages face recognition technology to automate the process of tracking student attendance. This project uses OpenCV for face detection and recognition, along with a user-friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter. It includes features for capturing images for training, real-time face recognition, and managing attendance records efficiently.

## Features
- **Face Recognition**: Automatically recognize students' faces and mark their attendance.
- **Image Capture**: Capture and save images for training the recognition model.
- **Manual Attendance**: Option to manually fill attendance records.
- **CSV Export**: Generate attendance reports in CSV format.
- **Database Integration**: Store attendance records in a MySQL database.
